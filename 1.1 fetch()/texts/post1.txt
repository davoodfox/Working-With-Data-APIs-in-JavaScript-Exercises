The main piece of this code for example purposes is the typedArrayToURL() function, which creates a Blob from the given typed array and returns an object URL for it. Having converted the data into an object URL, it can be used in a number of ways, including as the value of the <img> element's src attribute (assuming the data contains an image, of course).
